      <p>Seattle's weather is known for being unpredictable. It can go from sunny to rainy in a matter of minutes, so packing smart is essential to stay comfortable throughout your trip:</p>
      <ul>
          <li><strong>Layers:</strong> Opt for easily removable layers to adapt to fluctuating temperatures throughout the day. A base layer, a lightweight sweater, and a waterproof jacket should do the trick.</li>
          <li><strong>Rain gear:</strong> Seattleites often favor rain jackets over umbrellas. A good rain jacket will not only keep you dry but also blend in with the local style. Consider bringing a packable one that fits easily in your bag.</li>
          <li><strong>Comfortable shoes:</strong> Seattle is a very walkable city with lots of hills. Bring comfortable walking shoes or hiking boots if you plan to explore parks and outdoor areas.</li>
          <li><strong>Accessories:</strong> Don’t forget a good pair of sunglasses for those unexpected sunny moments and a hat to protect you from both rain and sun. A small backpack can be useful to carry these items around.</li>
          <li><strong>Miscellaneous:</strong> A reusable water bottle and a portable phone charger can be lifesavers during long days of sightseeing.</li>
      </ul>
